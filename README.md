## About The Project
What is a record show? According to Google's AI overview: "A record show is an event where people can buy and sell records, CDs, and other music-related items. Record shows can feature local, independent, and out-of-state vendors."

Record Show Mania is a website where users can search for record shows across the world, and registered users can advertise their events for free.

It is ranked as the #1 search result on Google for "record shows" or "record shows near me."

Here are some key numbers (with no paid advertising at all):

* 18,684 active users for the 2024 calendar year according to Google Analytics
* 439 registered users to date
* 1,856 shows have been advertised since 2019
